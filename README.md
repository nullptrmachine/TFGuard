# TFGuard

TFGuard is a software that automatically votekicks hackers and bots from the game, making it a safer and more enjoyable experience for legitimate players.

## Features

- Automatically detects and votekicks hackers and bots from the game
- Machine learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy
- Easy to use interface and install

## How it Works

TFGuard uses advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and votekick hackers and bots in real-time.
The software constantly analyzes player behavior and identifies patterns that are common among malicious users.
When a malicious user is detected, TFGuard automatically reports the user and initiates a votekick to remove the user from the game.
Now everytime suspect joins a server, any player using TFGuard will try to votekick the suspect.
All TFGuard clients work together to get job done. :)
